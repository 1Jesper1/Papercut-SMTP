# Papercut
The Simple SMTP Desktop Email Receiver

## Why?
Ever need to test emails from an application or web site but don't want them accidently being sent or having to deal with the hassle of setting up a test email server? Papercut is a quick email viewer with a built-in SMTP server designed to only receive messages. It doesn't enforce any restrictions how you send your email. It allows you to view the whole email-chilada: body, html, headers, attachment down to the naughty raw bits. It can be set to run on startup and sits quietly minimized in the tray giving you a ballon popup when a new message arrives.
